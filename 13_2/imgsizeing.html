    <h2>Do You want to get more flexible</h2>

    <p>Dancers, Gymnasts, Martial Artists, and just about everyone else who moves wants to be more flexible. While some people
        have issues with excessive mobility, most people would love some help on unlocking certain areas of their body for
        more freedom of movement. The funny thing is, for most people, stretching to get more flexible is just about the
        slowest and most dangerous way of getting there! Our bodies are very complex, and the restrictions to mobility can
        be many and varied. However, when you can identify and work on the real restriction to your mobility, then sudden
        and dramatic differences to your flexibility are possible! One of the most dramatic demonstrations of this is the
        Sub-occipital release technique that I use with young and old alike. No matter how many times I teach this technique,
        I am always delighted at the amazement on everyone’s face when their concept of flexibility transforms immediately!Dancers, Gymnasts, Martial Artists, and just about everyone else who moves wants to be more flexible. While some people

    <h2>I am injure and need help</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately after a serious injury, many dancers don’t get back to dancing fully again. Not because they can’t, but
        because they lose so much condition while being out due to injury, that their return to dance is plagued with even
        more injury, and it all becomes just too hard. Giving up what you love, what you live for, or what you feel you were
        born to do is something that I think no one should ever have to face. The “Will I Ever Dance Again?” Program will
        help you make the most of your time in rehab to not only recover fully, but to get back stronger, more flexible and
        better than ever.Unfortunately after a serious injury, many dancers don’t get back to dancing fully again. Not because they can’t, but

    <h2>Will I ever dance again?Coming Soon!!!</h2>

    <p>This is the story of a young dancer pursuing her dream of becoming a professional dancer in Europe, who had to return
        to Australia due to a serious injury. An injury that made her ask “Will I ever dance again?” It tells of her struggle,
        and of her triumph, and goes through every stage of the practical rehabilitation process that we used to get her
        back dancing better than ever. This extraordinary program aims to change that, by giving dancers an intense program
        of conditioning and technique enhancement that they can use while resting the injured foot, to allow for a full recovery,
        without falling behind their peers.This is the story of a young dancer pursuing her dream of becoming a professional dancer in Europe, who had to return
