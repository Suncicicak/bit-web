    <h1 id="title">Scuba diving</h1>
    <p class="intro">Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba)
        which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater.[1] Scuba divers carry their own source
        of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied
        divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.[1] Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing
        gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at
        high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range
        extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.[3] Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba
        systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so
        a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater
        compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit
        scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing
        marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.[1]</p>
    <p class="description">Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military
        and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable.
        Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.[4]
        A scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided
        by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface.[5] Other equipment includes a mask to improve underwater
        vision, exposure protection, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and
        purpose of the dive. Some scuba divers use a snorkel when swimming on the surface. Scuba divers are trained in the
        procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification
        organisations which issue these certifications.[6] These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment
        and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance
        of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training
        organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications.[7]</p>
        <p class="indent">The history of scuba diving is closely linked with the history of scuba equipment. By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth-limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets.[8] The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London.[9] His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus had no way of measuring the gas composition during use.[9][10] During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war.[11] In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services.[12] In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"),[13][2][14][15] which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.[16] After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity.[</p>
