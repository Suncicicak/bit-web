        athletes sponsored by Monster include three-time gold medal-winning skier David Wise, Olympic freestyle skier Gus
        Kenworthy and Olympic gold medalist snowboarder Iouri Podladtchikov.[19] Monster Energy broke into eSports with their
        sponsorship of Evil Geniuses, one of the premiere North American multi-game organizations.[20]</p>
    <p>In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would replace outgoing Sprint Corporation as the title sponsor
        of NASCAR's premier series. NASCAR's chief marketing officer cited Monster's "youthful and edgy" brand as a driving
        force behind the deal, as NASCAR seeks to build its younger audience and bolster the sport's long term health.[21][22]
        Monster is endorsed by driver Kurt Busch and currently sponsors his No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing car;[9] prior to joining
        SHR, Monster had sponsored the likes of Robby Gordon[23] Ricky Carmichael,[24] and the No. 54 Xfinity Series car
        of Joe Gibbs Racing/Kyle Busch Motorsports.[25][26] Mercedes F1 has been sponsored by Monster since 2010. And are
        currently endorsed by Valtteri Bottas and four time world champion Lewis Hamilton. The company was endorsed by Australian
        touring car driver Jamie Whincup from late 2009 to 2012. The deal was cancelled abruptly for the 2013 season, when
        his team Triple Eight signed rival company Red Bull as title sponsor. Monster is now associated with Prodrive Racing
        Australia as the primary sponsor of Cameron Waters Ford Falcon FG X. His teammate, current V8 Supercar Champion,
        Mark Winterbottom receives minor support as do the Holden Racing Team (since 2015). Monster has also sponsored several
        rally drivers and motocross riders, such as Ken Block, Liam Doran, Nani Roma, Jeremy McGrath, Chad Reed, Ryan Villopoto,
        Ricky Carmichael, Nate Adams and Taka Higashino. Monster Energy also sponsors multiple motocross race teams named
        "Monster Energy/Pro Circuit/Kawasaki",[27] and the Monster Energy Factory Yamaha motocross team, based in Hampshire,
        England. As of 2016, Monster has aided the return of factory Yamaha to United States as the title sponsor of the
        team, officially named Monster Energy/360fly/Chaparral/Yamaha Factory Racing. On January 6, 2012, the Monster Energy
        Monster Jam truck was debuted in Birmingham, Alabama.[28] It is currently campaigned by drivers Todd LeDuc and Coty
        Saucier. Monster Energy has been the title sponsor of the French motorcycle Grand Prix since 2010.[29] Since 2012,
        Monster Energy has been the main sponsor of the Speedway Grand Prix and Speedway World Cup.[30] In June 2015, Monster
        Energy agreed to a sponsorship deal with Zayat Stables to sponsor the race horse American Pharoah for an undisclosed
        sum, rumored to be the largest single-horse advertising sponsorship to date. The deal allows the product's logo to
        be used on the horse's horse sheets, on jockey Victor Espinoza's shirt and boots, as well as caps and other gear
        worn by people around the horse. "The energy and excitement that American Pharoah has generated around the world
        syncs perfectly with the brand."[31]</p>
    <p>Monster Beverage Corporation has been criticized for its policy to sue companies or groups which use the word "Monster"
        or the letter "M" in their marketing for trademark infringement. Examples include the aquarium hobbyist site MonsterFishKeepers.com,[32]
        Bevreview.com, a beverage review site which published an unfavorable review of the Monster Energy drink[33] and a
        Vermont microbrewery which marketed a beer named "Vermonster". Monster Beverage dropped the lawsuit against the microbrewery
        due to the negative publicity the lawsuit generated.[34] In August 2012, the Beastie Boys filed a lawsuit against
        the company for copyright infringement over Monster's use of their music in an online campaign.[35] In 2014, a jury
        found Monster Beverage Corp. had infringed on Beastie Boys copyright by using songs without permission, and owed
        the group $1.7 million.[36] In March 2016, Monster filed a lawsuit to revoke the company trademark of Thunder Beast
        LLC (Washington, DC),[37] a small root beer brewery, insisting the use of “beast” in the company name encroached
        on Monster’s trademark slogan “Unleash the Beast.”[38] The owner of Thunder Beast, Stephen Norberg, is currently
        fighting Monster’s lawsuit.[39] In June 2017, Page Zeringue, a former employee of Monster Energy Company, filed a
        complaint in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Monster Energy Company alleging
        that the beverage company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[40]. Zeringue began working for Monster
        Energy Company in Feb 2008. She alleges she was discriminated against because of her gender and was subjected to
        sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. The suit states she was terminated in October of 2015. Zeringue
        holds Monster Energy Company responsible because the defendant allegedly retaliated against her when she reported
        the unwelcome sexual advances to the human resources department. [41] In June 2017 Sara Rabuse of Los Angeles County
        filed a personal injury claim against Monster Energy Company Executive, Brent Hamilton and his employer, Monster
        Energy Company [42]. Rabuse is suing for damages while she was violently attacked during a Monster Energy work function
        Hamilton invited her to attend. Rabuse Claims Hamilton, Executive of the Monster Energy Music Department, flew her
        from L.A to meet him at the Country Music Awards in Nashville at Monster Energy’s Company expense. When she arrived
        in Nashville at the airport, he was drunk. Sara Rabuse claims the heavy drinking led to a fight in the hotel room,
        where Hamilton choked her[43]. Rabuse claims the only way to free herself from Hamilton’s grasp was to poke him in
        the eye, but when she did, Hamilton, bit her thumb. Rabuse claimed the bite got infected, forcing her to spend 24
        hours in the hospital. Rabuse holds Monster Energy Company responsible because the company allegedly knew of its
        employees drinking problem and ignored it[44]</p>
    <p>In December 2011, 14-year-old Anais Fournier died of "cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity" after drinking two
        710 ml (24 US fl oz) cans of Monster Energy drink containing a combined amount of ~475 mg caffeine. Fournier had
        a pre-existing heart condition, as well as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In October 2012, her parents sued the company.
        Monster has insisted that its energy drink played no role in Fournier's death.[45] A Freedom of Information Request
        revealed that from 2004 to 2012 the Food and Drug Administration had received reports of five deaths occurring after
        drinking Monster Energy. The reports did not prove a causal link between the drink and any health problems.[46] In
        May 2015, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned the sale of Monster and other energy drinks
        that contained both caffeine and ginseng.[47] Also in May 2015, Monster Energy was identified as the company that
        filed the most trademark objections in their category, for the year ending 2014.[48]</p>
